# Question Answering on a Knowledge Graph

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/deepset-ai/haystack/blob/master/tutorials/Tutorial10_Knowledge_Graph.ipynb)

Haystack allows storing and querying knowledge graphs with the help of pre-trained models that translate natural language questions to SPARQL queries..
This tutorial demonstrates how to load an existing knowledge graph into haystack, load a pre-trained retriever, and execute questions on the knowledge graph.
The training of models that translate natural language questions into SPARQL queries is currently not supported.


```python
# Install the latest release of Haystack in your own environment
#! pip install farm-haystack

# Install the latest master of Haystack
!pip install git+https://github.com/deepset-ai/haystack.git
```


```python
# Here are some imports that we'll need

import subprocess
import time
from pathlib import Path

from farm.utils import initialize_device_settings

from haystack.graph_retriever.kgqa import Text2SparqlRetriever
from haystack.knowledge_graph.graphdb import GraphDBKnowledgeGraph

```

## Launching a GraphDB instance


```python
# Unfortunately, there seems to be no good way to run GraphDB in colab environments
# Start a GraphDB server with docker
print("Starting GraphDB ...")
status = subprocess.run(
    ['docker run -d -p 7200:7200 --name graphdb-instance-lcquad docker-registry.ontotext.com/graphdb-free:9.4.1-adoptopenjdk11'], shell=True
)
if status.returncode:
    raise Exception("Failed to launch GraphDB. Maybe it is already running?")
time.sleep(30)
```

## Creating a new repository (also known as document index in haystack's document stores)


```python
# Initialize a new GraphDBKnowledgeGraph store, create an index and load triples into the store

kg = GraphDBKnowledgeGraph()
kg.create_index(config_path=Path("../data/repo-config.ttl"))
kg.index = "lcquad_full_wikidata"
kg.import_from_ttl_file(index="lcquad_full_wikidata", path=Path("../data/tutorial10_knowledge_graph.ttl"))

```


```python
# here are ten example triples

print(kg.get_all_triples()[:10])
```


```python
## Initialize Retriever, which translates questions from natural language text to SPARQL queries
device, n_gpu = initialize_device_settings(use_cuda=True)
kgqa_retriever = Text2SparqlRetriever(knowledge_graph=kg, model_name_or_path="../saved_models/lcquad_full_wikidata", top_k=1)
```

## Query Execution

We can now ask question that will be answered by our knowledge graph!
One limitation though: our pre-trained model can only generate questions about entities it has seen during training.
Otherwise it cannot translate the name of the entity to the identifier used in the knowledge graph.


```python
result = kgqa_retriever.retrieve(question_text="What periodical literature does Delta Air Lines use as a moutpiece?")
## SPARQL query: select distinct ?obj where { wd:Q188920 wdt:P2813 ?obj . ?obj wdt:P31 wd:Q1002697 }
## Answer: wd:Q3486420
```
